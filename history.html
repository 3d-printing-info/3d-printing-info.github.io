        So how did 3D printing come to be what it has become today? The technology behind 3D printing was created a long time ago, but it has been slowly evolving over the past 40 years. According to the article History of 3D Printing: It's Older Than You Think from Autodesk, Dr. Hideo Kodama filed the first patent for a 3D printer. Rather than using metals like other past projects, he used a unique plastic. This plastic was then added in layers and it would harden forming the model. Although the idea seems ingenious now, it wasn't accepted then, so it faded away. The Autodesk article also stated that “Inventor Chuck Hull was the first person to build a 3D printer.” He created a certain kind of printer called a <b>stereolithographic apparatus</b>. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers infographic “A Timeline of 3D Printing Technology” detailed how throughout the next decade, 3D printing began to get further developed and further popularized. Many companies were then founded and they went on to extend the technologies behind 3D printing. In 2005, a new 3D printing concept was introduced called RepRap. RepRap is when 3D printers can 3D print other 3D printers. This opened the doors for 3D printed 3D printers such as the “Darwin” in 2008. By 2019, most of the original 3D printer patents had expired, so new 3D printer manufacturers such as Prusa and Voxel8 entered this industry to join over 170 3D printer companies. It is an industry that will be worth $51 billion by 2030.
