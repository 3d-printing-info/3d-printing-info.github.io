    <h1>What is 3D Printing and How does it Work?</h1>

    <p>
        The process of 3D printing is a form of creating objects through an <b>additive process</b>. The most common form of 3D printing called <b>FDM</b> takes plastic and molds it into the desired object. A video called How 3D Printers Work from National Geographic Kids used the analogy of icing on a cake to describe this process. Like icing on a cake, 3D printers stack layers to form an object slowly. Little by little, the little layers make a big object. But how do these layers get made? Well, the majority of 3D printers use plastic but some 3D printers can use more durable materials like ceramic and metal. Polymers like PLA and PETG can only be used in a 3D printer if they are a long string (usually 1.75mm in diameter). After that, it pushes the string through a nozzle (also known as an extruder). Once out of the nozzle, it is applied in layers as it moves in all directions to form the model. Overall, 3D printing is comprised of many simple stages to make a complex process.

        However, behind the printer, there is much more. The 3D printer needs to have some way of knowing where to go, how hot to make the nozzle and many other things. First, a <b>CAD</b> designer has to use CAD software to develop a model. This CAD software creates a model in the form of a STL or OBJ file and then the model has to be sent to a slicer. As stated in the National Geographic Video, “[The slicer] then looks at [a] digital model and it slices it up into layers, just like icing on a cake. After that, the 3D printer can take these layers and create each one right on top of the other until you get your full model” [2:00-2:05]. To add on, the 3D printer takes the slices in the form of detailed commands and it uses these commands to perform desired movements and actions. These commands are stored in a G-Code file. Imagine a G-Code file as a human's brain. Both the human brain and a G-Code file are in charge of telling various things what to do and how to do it. All in all, from concept to reality, many steps are required to make a 3D-printed object.
