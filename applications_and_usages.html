        Third, 3D printing has many uses and applications. From housing to manufacturing to militaries, it is used everywhere. First, 3D printing is used in the affordable housing industry. The company ICON uses a giant 3D printer to print out houses using concrete. The Newsela article “Houses rolling off a 3-D printer? Yes, and some are ready to be tested” mentioned that the 3D printed houses company called ICON has teamed up with the affordable housing company called New Story to build houses in countries and regions that suffer from poverty and homelessness. Together, these two companies are tackling the homelessness crisis. Likewise, 3D printers are being used in a different aspect of the commercial industry; the manufacturing and prototyping industry. Companies are starting to use 3D printing to quickly and efficiently create prototypes and final products. As mentioned in an article called “What’s New in Commercial Uses for 3D Printing?” from HP, 3D printing has many advantages and benefits for companies. It can cut costs and save time. Especially in the prototyping stages, 3D printing can save time due to its on-demand aspect and quick outputs. Rather than waiting for <b>injection molding</b> companies to make prototypes, companies can create their prototypes in-house and on demand. Additionally, 3D printing allows companies to make intricate designs using materials that other methods don’t support. Finally, militaries worldwide are using 3D printers to create drones on demand and the front lines. According to the article “Military wants to 3-D print robots, drones, spare parts” from Newsela, “By giving soldiers kits of electronic parts and equipping bases with the printers, they envision a future in which troops in the field could build their drones in a matter of hours.” It can allow militaries to not be delayed by the long wait time to get new drones. Additionally, Navy Captain Frank Futcher who is in charge of implementing 3D printing into vessels across the world said that 3D printing was “transformative”. He mentioned that this technology helps the Navy and other US armed branches stay ahead of the curve and outperform other militaries in combat. Overall, 3D printing has revolutionized, the commercial prototyping, affordable housing, and military drone industries.
