        <b>Additive process/Additive manufacturing</b>: Additive manufacturing is when an item is constructed by adding material, not subtracting it. The process of 3D printing is an example of an additive process because the material is stacked and added to create an object. However, sculpting is not an additive process because you subtract material not add it.

        <b>Fused deposition modeling (FDM)</b>: Fused deposition modeling or FDM is the process of fusing melted materials to create a model. FDM 3D printers usually melt plastic and then deposit it to create a model.

        <b>Polymer</b>: A compound of high molecular weight derived either by the addition of many smaller molecules, such as polyethylene, or by the condensation of many smaller molecules with the elimination of water, alcohol, or the like, such as nylon. (<b>Dictionary.com</b>) One example of a polymer is plastic.

        <b>CAD</b>: CAD or computer-aided design is the process of digitally designing models using a computer. Using software like Onshape, Fusion360, AutoCAD, and Solidworks, a designer can make a digital model. CAD software can be used to design a concept model, a model for 3D printing, or a model for a different form of manufacturing.

        <b>Steriolithic apparatus (SLA)</b>: A steriolithic apparatus or an SLA machine is a certain type of 3D printer that uses UV light to harden a liquid polymer. It is known for being able to fabricate precise models. It is important to note that an SLA machine is different from an FDM machine.
